                    <p>
                        Covid-19 has caused many students to feel isolated from peers, friends and teachers. Isolation can cause students to feel less motivated and discouraged from completing school tasks.
                        A recent poll found that 7 out of 10 Ontarians believe that there will be a ‚Äòserious mental health crisis‚Äô as a result of the pandemic (stats based off of CMHA). 
                        Online school has increased the number of students with mental health problems, and there has to be ways to help decrease the numbers, as unfortunately the pandemic is not ending anytime soon.
                    </p>

                    <h3>"Students need a support system especially while being isolated at home.‚Äù</h3>
                    <p>
                    My solution to this problem is creating a virtual assistant to provide a personalized aid to help students stay motivated with custom reminders, motivational messages and just a friend to chat with.
                    My goal is to create an easy to use application where students can easily navigate without the help of their parents/friends.

                    <p> When thinking about my target user, I thought about students and the changes Covid-19 has caused them.
                        Many high school and university students (ages 14-22) were comfortable to learning in a classroom environment,
                        around other students, peers, and educators. When learning online, it is more difficult for teachers to read their 
                        students' faces and see if they are having a hard time. In addition, students need the presence of classmates to chat with, 
                        and being around other students, improves the student's motivation. Thus, our target audience is high school and university students, 
                        who have lost a sense of motivation and feel isolated. Mona is a perfect example; before covid, she had swimming practice, studied with her 
                        friends at the library after school, and loved interacting with classmates.
                        She is currently feeling lonely with the new online classes, and she says she misses interacting with her peers. 
                        She notes that studying with her friends on zoom doesn't feel the same and sometimes it's hard arranging a time to study together due to different schedules.

                <p> Using my research, my target user, as well as keeping the problem and the goal in mind, I sketched out the rough interactions on the iPad. I sketched out the basics for the three web pages and how the user is able to navigate through them (as easily as possible).

                    <h2><mark>Designing.</mark></h2>
                    <p> Using the wireframes, we began brainstorming colours and designs.
                        The design was all created on Figma, and after doing some UX research, we decided to use pastel colours and the Monserrat and Arial fonts because they are calming tones and easy-to-read fonts.
                        We also thought of naming our chatbot liv, as it is an easy name to remember and pronounce for the student.
                        <br>
                        This was our first prototype of the web app.
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        <div class="vid">
                            <video autoplay="" muted="" class="vid" id="" loop="loop">
                                <source src="images/StudyBuddyP1.MP4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            </video></div>
                            
                            
                
                    
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        However, after a couple of user interviews, we created a new prototype with a more straightforward design.
                         We eliminated the clouds theme to keep a more simple design and added more buttons to help with navigation.
                          One of our users explained how she would prefer to have the ability to close the chatbot to not distract her
                           from studying. This allows students to focus on the todo-list and, when wanting to chat, quickly be able to
                            open the chatbot. 
                            <br>
                        Our final prototype:
                    </p>

                        <br>

                        <h2><mark>How we built it.</mark></h2>
                       
                        <p>
                        After designing the web app, we began developing. We used Bootstrap, Javascript and HTML/CSS to build the web application. 
                        The chatbot AI was integrated using Dialogflow‚Äôs API, and the todo-list was created with Angularjs.
                        The web application allows students to create a todo-list and chat with liv (chatbot) to define a set 
                        of goals to complete for the day, and the chatbot will send friendly reminders. 
                        Liv can also play music, play some study with me vlogs from YouTube, and provide motivational and 
                        uplifting quotes as you are studying. These commands were all created on Dialogflow.
